### Project:
To be finalised...

Make sure to use git to it's full extent
- Before you start working on anything, do a `git pull` and then start. Also once you're done, make sure to do a `git push`.
- Make continuous commits.
- Make a commit for every significant change.
- For example if you have to add two functionalities in your code: addition and subtraction; you write code for addition and make a commit and then write code for subtraction and make a commit.
- If there is some bug, raise an issue and then solve the bug.
- Your commits must explain what was changed. It should not be something like "Update README"; it should be "Change name in README.md".
- If needed, give a commit description.
