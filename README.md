### Project:
To be finalised...

Make sure to use git to it's full extent
- Make continuous commits
- Make a commit for every significant change
- For example if you have to add two functionalities in your code: addition and subtraction; you write code for addition and make a commit and then write code for subtraction and make a commit
- If there is some bug, raise an issue and then solve the bug
